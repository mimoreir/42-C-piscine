File Interactions

chmod > change rights to files

echo > has Terminal showing what is typed

man > manual

ls > list all documents and folders in current location

ls -l > ful description of files and folders in current location

man ls > list of all commands for "ls"

cat -e [FILENAME]	> shows all characters "paragraphs, etc...." used
"$" > signals a hard return when placed after the text, if before it is meant to show the content of a variable, if a variable is in use, ex: echo miguel = miguel shows up in terminal, if echo $miguel=it shows whatever is in that variable

touch > creates a file

chmod > allows for permission modding, User-Group-Other, 421=r(ead), w(rite), e(x)ecute
Permission change, to use numbers we set a ___, a sum of the numbers for each user/group
eg: read and write for me, read for group and read for others
	chmod 644 [FILE_NAME]

touch -t "DOC_NAME"> modify file information regarding date and time

tar -cf [FOLDER_NAME] [FILE_TO_BE_ZIPPED]

wc -l returns de number of lines of a file

if I use cat on a big file will not show the entire file
to show the entire file use -> more [File Name]
to search while acessing a file use /[word] and repeat to find one ahead of the first one.

head -n X show X lines of a file
	-c X for characters
tail -n X show X lines of a file starting from the end
	-c X for characters (in this case we have to count with the character of the hard return)

grep [WORD][FILENAME]
grep to find the lines with the search parameter
grep -v to find the lines without the search parameter
grep -i to make the search not case sensitive

> write in the file and deletes is previous content
>> adds to the file

cat << [WORD]
let you write to a file on terminal until you write de [WORD]
to do and put the words to a file you use:
cat << [WORD] > [FILENAME]

ls bonjour *txt > test.txt 2>&1
find file bonjour and all txt files and errors or good results are puted on test.txt

find .
find . -name [FILENAME]
find . -type d/f
find . -maxdepth [NUMBER]----> 0 only sees itself

bc starts the linux calculator

cat -e [file name] shows all the hard returns on the file
